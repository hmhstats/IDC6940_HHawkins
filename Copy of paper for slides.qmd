## Introduction

## What is Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS)? {.small}

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">


- STS mimics PTSD, resulting from indirect exposure to others' trauma [@figley1995compassion; @baird2006vicarious]
- Common in service professions:
  - Therapists
  - First responders
  - Teachers
- Symptoms include:
  - Intrusion
  - Avoidance
  - Arousal [@bride2004development]
- STS affects both mental and physical health

## STS and Teachers

- Teachers are exposed to trauma:
  - **Directly:** school violence, threats
  - **Indirectly:** student trauma from abuse, poverty, neglect

- High-needs / Title I schools → higher risk of STS [@inabnett2023secondary]

- Teacher well-being is linked to stress and school conditions [@kidger2016teachers]

## STS, Burnout, and Attrition

- Chronic stress leads to burnout → emotional, mental, and physical toll [@baker2021experience]

- Burnout dimensions: emotional exhaustion, cynicism, inefficacy [@chang2009appraisal]

- Burnout types:
  - Personal
  - Work-related
  - Student-related [@de2017burnout]

- Burnout contributes to teacher attrition [@hilton2021predicting]

## STS Measurement & Relevance to Study

- STS measured by Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS):  
  17 items across intrusion, avoidance, arousal subscales [@bride2004development]

- Inabnett (2023): STS significantly predicted attrition beyond other factors

- Hilton (2021): Though STS not measured, findings support its indirect impact

- Teacher support & student trauma linked to attrition

- Current study: Predict attrition using STSS in Northwest Florida


##Methods

## Overview of Analysis Method

- Goal: Predict teacher attrition (stay vs. leave) using STSS responses

- Method: Binary Logistic Regression

- Useful for predicting binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no, stay/leave) [@peng2002introduction]


## Binary Logistic Regression Basics

- Outcome variable is binary (coded 0 or 1)

- Predictor variables can be continuous or categorical

- Categorical variables converted to dummy variables [@tranmer2008binary]

- Model estimates the probability of an event (teacher leaving)

## Key Logistic Regression Concepts

- Logistic function:

$$
\pi = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k)}}
$$

where \(\pi\) = probability of teacher leaving

- Models log-odds (logit):

$$
\text{logit}(\pi) = \ln\left(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k
$$

- Exponentiated coefficients → odds ratios (e.g., OR = 1.5 means 50% increased odds)

## Assumptions & Model Evaluation

### Assumptions:

- Binary dependent variable
- Independent observations
- No perfect multicollinearity
- Linear relationship between continuous predictors & log odds
- Sufficient sample size (≥10 events per predictor)

### Model evaluation:

- Goodness-of-fit tests
- Likelihood ratio tests
- Predictor significance (p-values)
- Classification accuracy [@peng2002introduction]

## Implementation & Predictors

- **Software:** RStudio using packages like `lmtest`, `MASS`, `fastDummies`, `tidyverse`

- **Predictors:** STSS subscale scores for Intrusion, Avoidance, Arousal

- **Outcome:** Probability a teacher will leave the profession
