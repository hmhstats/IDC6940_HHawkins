Dear Participant, As current teacher
in Santa Rosa County School District, you are invited to participate in a study
titled, “Exploring Secondary Traumatic Stress in K-12 Educators.”  Please note that participation in this study
is completely voluntary.  If you choose
to participate, you should expect to spend approximately fifteen minutes
completing an electronic questionnaire.  You may choose to discontinue your
participation at any time without repercussions.  The study is being conducted by Melanie
DiLoreto, an instructor of teacher education at the University of West
Florida.   Overview of Study The following
research project activities demonstrate my professional commitment to
understanding the influence secondary traumatic stress (STS) has on educators’
experiences and their thoughts about leaving the teaching profession.  There is a nationwide shortage of teachers
and enrollment in educator preparation programs is at an all-time low across
the United States (Walker, 2019).  There
are various reasons reported for this shortage, some of which refer to teacher
burn-out.  However, a fairly new
phenomenon in the literature focuses on teachers’ STS or STS disorder (STSD)
from personally connecting with numerous students who report their own
tragedies to their teachers.  It is suspected that STS is a major
contributor of teachers leaving or avoiding the profession.  This research is only recently budding in the
literature as there are few studies of its sort.  By understanding this newly identified
phenomenon, I hope to better engage pre-service and in-service educators with
these topics.

Benefits and RisksThe education community
at large may benefit from this study as a result of a better understanding of
the traumatic stress that teachers experience. 
Furthermore, these results may be used as a means to better understand
how traumatic stress may impact teachers’ plans for beginning or staying in the
field of education.  Finally, by
disseminating the results at a conference presentation or publication in an
appropriate journal, the results of this study may add to the existing body of
knowledge about teachers’ secondary traumatic stress and how it may impact
future plans of those teachers.  Although there are
no foreseeable risks, it is understood that teachers may not want to share
their feelings about secondary traumatic stress and/or their plans for staying
or leaving the teaching profession. 
Please know that responses are anonymous, and that any identifying information
inadvertently collected throughout the study will be removed immediately.  Only aggregate data will be included for the
results of this study.  These data will
remain secure, and they will be destroyed within three years of the data
collection.  Results from the analyses of
the data may be used in professional conferences and educational journals.  ResultsIf you would like
a copy of the results, please send an email request to Dr. Melanie DiLoreto at mdiloreto@uwf.edu.  If you have any questions or concerns with
this research, feel free to contact Dr. DiLoreto at 850.857.6496.  If you would like to speak with someone other
than the researcher, you may contact the University of West Florida

There is sometimes the belief that if teachers had better relationships with the students that we can prevent that from happening, but it simply is not true.  I do think there needs to be better support for teachers in those situations, not blame.  Every teacher I have worked with was a teacher because they love working with kids and when a child escalates the situation the teachers work very hard to de-escalate.  Support for all they do would go a long way in retaining teachers at those tougher schools."

We are no longer just educators; we wear countless hats and it is too much. TOO MUCH. Not to mention the cost: physically, mentally, and emotionally. I wish with all the wishes in the world that I could leave the profession and work in a field where I’m paid adequately and appreciated for my value. "

Generally the school systems provide free counseling services to their teachers, which is an amzing thing, but I feel like not enough teachers utilize it. I have experienced personal trauma in the past and I feel it helps me better understand what the student may be feeling or struggling with. I am constantly reminding my students that it is ok to not be ok and that we all struggle with things and to reach out for help from someone becuase nothing is more important than their life. "

I have had the unique opportunity to see straight into students' homes rather than learn about the home lives of my students indirectly from a brick and mortar setting. in this setting. The lack of support that students have at home regarding their education is more easily observable. The students in the remote setting were put there voluntarily by their guardians for various reasons. If the parents and guardians of these children signed up for this option and refuse to provide necessary support at home in this setting, it opens doors to the awareness of how many parents/guardians are unwilling to support their children in all settings. The secondary trauma that I have from watching my students try their best to succeed and communicate with their ""learning coach"" at home is overwhelming. Seeing into their homes and witnessing their struggles when trying to get their parents to participate in and facilitate their learning gives the unwanted visual memory of all students being denied that support, no matter the learning option they have chosen. This is a unique experience on top of the previously accumulated secondary traumas I have experienced in previous years that would have, to others, seem ""worse."" There is something about seeing into the homes of your students that makes these experiences that much more vivid and ""real."" I will never teach remotely again because of this reason, if this learning option is offered in the future school years. I will, although, continue teaching in a brick and mortar setting; at least in this setting I am in complete control of their learning experience while at school, where as in the remote setting, the parent or guardian takes partial responsibility since they are the facilitators of their learning."
